# FruityFridge

FruityFridge is an Android application that helps users track their food in the fridge.

Before putting food in the fridge, users can use this app to take photos of the food without entering the names,
and the app can automatically recognize the food using our trained machine learning model from Google Cloud AutoML Vision and display icons of the food.

By using FruityFridge, users can simply check this app to see what food they have in the fridge and thereby reduce food waste. :)
